# TODO
* Set up basic project: done, but need to get it working with argp-standalone on windows
* Set up github action (do we build release and debug?)
* Go for C++ 23 or 26?
* Upgrade to CMake 4.0.0
* Take existing functionality, add stuff required for agbpacker and go 1.0.0
* When we use argpppp in another project:
  * Can we easily choose whether to build tests or not? How does e.g. Catch2 do this?
  * Can we choose whether to use argp-standalone or not?
* Write README.md / documentation / example
